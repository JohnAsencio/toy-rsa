# toy-rsa

This assignment I coded a "toy-rsa" in Rust. I followed the psuedocode given to me in 
the assignment directions. It was pretty straightforward but I came into some problems 
when I started implementing the decode function and with the types and calculation. After
I resolved that, I made an example.rs where I ran the test using the example test given to 
us in the assignment directions. After that I designed my own tests in the tests directory.
I tried to make my tests truly randomized using rand, but i could not import the crate.
The tests were sufficient enough for me to see what was going on.
